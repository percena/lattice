"""Check whether a skill is still active on the CURRENT branch of a transcript.

Claude Code transcripts are an append-only DAG: every event carries a ``uuid``
and ``parentUuid``. A ``/rewind`` (or an edited/retried turn) starts a new branch
from an earlier node — the abandoned branch's events physically REMAIN in the
.jsonl file. ``/rewind`` fires no hook, so the skill-activation marker written by
track-skill-activation.sh is never cleared when the user rewinds past a skill load.

This helper lets intercept-gh-pr-create.sh re-validate a marker: a skill counts as
active only if its activation sits in the ancestry of the current (latest)
main-conversation leaf. A load that was rewound away lives on an abandoned branch
and is therefore NOT an ancestor, so the guard can correctly re-engage.

A skill can be activated two ways, both of which write the same marker:
  * the ``Skill`` tool (PreToolUse:Skill -> track-skill-activation.sh) — appears as
    an assistant ``tool_use`` block named "Skill";
  * a ``/skill`` slash command (UserPromptSubmit -> hooks/track-skill-slash-command.sh) —
    expanded inline, so it appears as a user message whose text begins with the raw
    slash command (e.g. ``/create-pr`` or ``/lattice:create-pr``) or carries
    a synthesized ``<command-name>`` tag. Only bare and exact ``lattice:`` forms
    count (hard cut — foreign namespaces are not component-stripped).

Matching these structured signals (not a bare substring) avoids the false positives
that originally motivated replacing transcript grepping with markers.

SAFETY: this helper must FAIL OPEN. It returns 1 ("block") only on a confident,
fully-parsed "absent" determination. Any ambiguity — unreadable/undecodable file,
any line that failed to parse, a dangling parent chain, or an unexpected error —
returns 2 so the caller honours the marker. An uncaught exception would exit 1 and
be misread as "absent", so everything runs under a guard that converts errors to 2.

Usage:  skill-active-in-transcript.py <transcript_path> <skill_name>

Exit codes (consumed by the caller, which fails OPEN on anything but 1):
  0  skill IS active in the current branch  -> allow
  1  skill is POSITIVELY absent (rewound away) -> let the caller block
  2  undetermined (missing/empty/unreadable/parse error/ambiguous) -> caller fails open

    Claude Code stores a slash invocation as a synthesized command block — the

    actually IS such a block (text starts with the tag), so user-authored prose
    that merely quotes `<command-name>/create-pr</command-name>` cannot spoof an
    activation and bypass the guard. The raw `/skill` form is also accepted, but
    only anchored at the very start of the message.

    KNOWN LIMITATION: Claude Code stores no field distinguishing a synthesized
    slash block from user-typed text, so a user who already holds a stale marker
    could in principle bypass the guard by sending a message that begins with a
    literal `<command-name>/create-pr</command-name>`. This is accepted: the guard
    is a workflow nudge, not a boundary against the operator themselves (who can
    disable the hook or call `gh api` directly), and recognising genuine slash
